# Topic HTML and CSS

● Create a basic portfolio page layout using the html tags.

● Add some style to the tags using css selectors.

●We will be using a modern framework to create native mobile apps - called React Native. React Native builds on the HTML, CSS and Javascript used for the web to create modern mobile apps.

●HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).

Tag

< > open

</> close

First, we write the tag <!DOCTYPE HTML> to tell the computer that this is going to be an HTML page. This informs the browser that it is going to read an HTML page. This is a must do for all HTML pages. All our HTML content comes inside the opening <html> tag and closing </html> tag.

Inside <html> tags, we can have <head> tags and <body> tags. Inside <head> tags, we store information about the page. Inside <body> tags we write content which is displayed on the web page.

navigation menu as well which can lead to other webpages. These are called hyperlinks. We use <a> tag to create hyperlinks. Let's create two hyperlinks - Projects and About Me.

# Topic CSS and Flexbox

● Create a separate CSS style sheet for the portfolio website. 

● Use <div> blocks and flexbox to give a layout to the website. 

● Use css selectors to add style elements to the website.

the <style> tag to add styling to the document. Typically, designers/developers try to create content and styling in two different documents so that content and design are independent of each other. This creates consistent design for different pages of a website easily. It also allows for a change in the design template of a website easily without affecting the content page.

Developers need to create two different and separate styling pages to create these two different designs. We call such styling page “CSS (cascading style sheet).”

Creating a CSS is quite simple. 

1. Create an empty file in the same folder and call it style.css (or any other name. The extension .css is important) This is going to be our style sheet.
2. Copy the style content (inside style tags) to this style sheet. We are going to add more styling to our document in this and the next class. 
3. This stylesheet needs to be linked to the html file. We do it using the <link/> tag.
